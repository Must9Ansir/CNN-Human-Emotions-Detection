# CNN-Human-Emotions-Detection
# Facial Expression Recognition is an essential component of computer vision applications and human-computer interaction. 
# This project aims to build a deep learning model to accurately classify facial expressions into seven different categories: happy, sad, angry, surprised, disgusted, fearful, and neutral. 
# The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architecture to achieve this task and evaluates its performance on a dataset containing images of human faces with labeled emotions.
